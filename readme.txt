Use wordpress's internal cron system to hit an external cron on a daily basis

== Description ==

Some hosts suck.  They don't include basic things like cron that plenty of scripts need.  Luckily for us, we can mimic `wget http://example.com` with this plugin.  It's about as simple as plugins get, but should make your life a bit easier.

== Installation ==


1. Upload `wordpress-hit-an-external-cron.php` to the `plugins` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the URL of the page you want to hit daily to the Settings > External Cron Settings screen
1. Drink a glass of scotch and be happy that your bad host is no longer an issue

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What kind of scotch should I drink in step 4 =

There is no perfect answer to this.  As an everyday scotch, I think you can do much worse then the Highland Park 12.
